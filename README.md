# Savefile Saver

I created this project as a solution to a simple, but annoying problem: Backing up my game savefiles. I wanted to be able to copy all of my
saved data from a game, into a folder, where I could then put it onto a USB as a backup. It's certainly possible to do manually, but it becomes
tedious after a while. So, Savefile Saver was born.
